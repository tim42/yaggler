Here are listed some key points for the future of YÃ¤gGLer:

* Finish the first pass of documentation
  * Add documentation for `bleunw/`
* Add some samples
  * Add samples for klmb
  * Add samples for bleunw
  * Add samples for plain yaggler
* Add DSA when the openGL version supports it
* Add a task scheduler in bleunw
* Improves how textures / bindless textures are handled
  * Refactor a bit that code (the one marked with TODOs)
* Add a `compositor_wrapper` (that act like `material_wrapper`)
  * Or create a `compositor_list` (a kind of tuple) and a wrapper for a `compositor_list` (with only a render() method)
