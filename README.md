=======

**YägGLer** is a kind of 3D renderer, mainly focused on beeing non user-friendly.

-------------

**Your IDE won't help you, and your compiler is broken.**

_(should build on g++ 4.8.2 and clang++ 3.2)_

-------------

YägGLer is not intended to be user friendly.

YägGLer is not intended to _"produce"_ a beautiful code.

YägGLer does not optimise for you.

YägGLer does not abstract OpenGL, you have to know OpenGL (or whatever the _"backend"_ is) to use YägGLer.

YägGLer does not help you to code.

YägGLer does not have inheritence/strict hardcoded structure, but implicit patterns (that you had to now, and are undocumented)
