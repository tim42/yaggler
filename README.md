-------------

YagGLer is not intended to be user friendly.
YagGLer is not intended to "produce" beautifull code.
YagGLer does not optimise for you.
YagGLer does not abstract OpenGL, you have to know OpenGL
        (or whatever the "backend" is) to use YagGLer.
YagGLer does not help you to code.
YagGLer does not have inheritence/strict hardcoded structure,
        but implicit patterns (that you had to now, and are undocumented)

-------------

You IDE won't help you, and your compiler is buggy, you can't use YagGLer.
