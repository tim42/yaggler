=======

**YägGLer** is a kind of 3D renderer, mainly focused on being non user-friendly.

_(although some side effects make him a fast and lightweight renderer)_

-------------

_(should build on g++ 4.8+ and clang 3.2/3.3)_

-------------

NOTE
----

Please note that this project is an experiement about making an really fast
renderer which resulting assembly code would be as simple as possible.
This project is unfinished yet, un-commented yet, and is not meant for
everyday use. 

For an example, you should look at the sample and the material code (in yaggler/klmb/material).

I have some code yet un-commited, and plans for the future ( *including*
some doxygen comments ;) )
